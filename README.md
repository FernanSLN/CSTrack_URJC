# CSTrack-URJC

# In this repository all the work done by the URJC team can be found.
## The main functions to create visualisations are stored in the utils file, which is the central axis of all the project
## In the different folders the general graphs, barplots, temp series, etc... are placed. Also, in some folders these same elements but with filtering proccess can also be encountered (ICALT, IEEE, COVID and SDGS by now)
## The rest of the processes are stored in the folders with the correspondent names (machine learning algorithms, NER or some others)
